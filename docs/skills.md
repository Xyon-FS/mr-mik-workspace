# Project skills

Ten maintained skills ship in this fork. `.agents/skills` is the maintained source
for Codex; `.claude/skills` contains complete, identical copies for Claude Code,
including scripts and references. Both Skills sections open the full instructions.
These are local project files, not global installations.

Claude reads the instructions in its own `SKILL.md` when a skill is used; a
Markdown link is just a request to read another file, not automatic inheritance.
The template includes full folders so a normal Windows clone needs no symlinks.
See [Claude's skill format](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills).

For shared changes, edit `.agents/skills`, then run `npm run skills:sync`.
If you edited a Claude copy directly, first move that intended change into the
maintained source. `npm run test:template` checks that the two copies agree.

| Skill | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| [3d-production-routing](../.agents/skills/3d-production-routing/SKILL.md) | Choose a practical workflow for 3D concepts, generated meshes, material maps, procedural Three.js reconstruction and game animation. |
| [blender-game-animation](../.agents/skills/blender-game-animation/SKILL.md) | Rig and animate supplied characters in Blender, revise motion from references, and deliver editable sources plus a verified game export. |
| [character-sheet-pipeline](../.agents/skills/character-sheet-pipeline/SKILL.md) | Prepare strict-front character sheets, isolated parts and optional multiview references for 3D modeling from an approved image. |
| [feature-handoff](../.agents/skills/feature-handoff/SKILL.md) | Prepare a precise handoff for an agent or developer implementing a feature, continuing a task or reviewing a finished change. |
| [image-reference-workflow](../.agents/skills/image-reference-workflow/SKILL.md) | Explore image concepts and make faithful edits of accepted references for 3D or creative production, with explicit model choices and visual review. |
| [img2threejs](../.agents/skills/img2threejs/SKILL.md) | Turn an object or character reference image into a quality-gated, animation-ready procedural Three.js model built in code. Use for image-to-3D reconstruction, detail-accurate object rebuilds, stylized/likeness-maximized human characters, sculpt specs, and staged code generation. |
| [materials-to-game](../.agents/skills/materials-to-game/SKILL.md) | Create or apply material maps and bake a textured high-poly mesh onto a game mesh, with channel, UV and export checks. |
| [plan](../.agents/skills/plan/SKILL.md) | Turn a broad project request into a small actionable plan with concrete deliverables, dependencies and acceptance checks. |
| [video-watch](../.agents/skills/video-watch/SKILL.md) | Inspect a local or publicly accessible video through sampled scene frames, timestamps and a visual report, especially for motion and 3D reference analysis. |
| [workspace-authoring](../.agents/skills/workspace-authoring/SKILL.md) | Create or maintain Workspace cards, report tabs and Markdown deliverables with consistent styling, working media previews and clear project organization. |

Provider-specific fal.ai/Higgsfield, motion-reference and dictation modules are not restored automatically from the original optional set. Keep the full img2threejs folder and its licenses when copying it.

The [game skill pack](skill-pack.md) adds six workflows in 0.2.1: game-animation-integration, game-audio-workflow, game-level-design, game-ui-workflow, game-vfx-workflow and gameplay-visual-review. Matching Codex/Claude copies are included. They start Off in Hub controls; existing customized folders and scope settings are preserved during updates. See the pack guide for enabling, workspace overrides and the native CLI discovery distinction.

Workspace authoring and video inspection also reference this
repository's processes, knowledge and scripts. Copy those referenced files when
extracting a module, or share the full template. Planning and handoff skills use
the local project conventions rather than another person's memory.

A skill does not authenticate a provider or install a tool. Follow its setup
references and bring your own account. Credentials and raw paid-job receipts
must stay outside a shared skill pack.
